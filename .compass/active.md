# Active Tasks

## PLAN-017 Wave 6 - zero-decision (SPEC-006 D-05; the human's bar, verbatim in the spec)

- [ ] TASK-015: automatic host detection - no roster question, no plugin.yaml field, no setup ask
- [ ] TASK-016: dsh-first bootstrap - a project whose first session is dsh materializes itself
- [ ] TASK-017: both-direction zero-decision acceptance on fresh projects

## Sizing + discoverability initiative

Triggered by a live failure in another project: a vision session produced seven epic-sized needs and Compass proposed seven flat specs with no signal anything was wrong.

- [ ] Open: pin the project where the seven-monster-specs session happened ([[LESSON-pin-the-motivating-datum]]).

## Per-domain organization initiative

- [ ] D-13 follow-up: grep across all indexes made the most obvious first move for agents (capability + rule nudge; folds into TASK-119's strategy work)
- [ ] v0.15.0's premature skill/sync edits were reverted; index depth-0 rule stays (shipped); everything further waits on the plan.

## Next Up

- [ ] SubagentStop typed-signal fix, fleet-wide (payload evidence captured: `agent_type` empty string). Queued in [[backlog]].
- [ ] [[SPEC-006-multi-host-agent-cli-support]] hosts: hermes first, then deepseek-harness (dsh; fit assessed in [[research/distribution/RESEARCH-deepseek-harness-fit]], 2026-09-04), then Kimi Code / Codex.
- [ ] Blinded rerun of the test-bar experiment ([[LESSON-blind-the-author-in-self-validation]]).
- [ ] Review and approve all plugin files - 3/21 approved, paused since 2026-03-12; largely superseded by the per-file reviews every later plan performed.

## Blocked

- Fleet pushes outstanding from the v0.6.x waves: 7 projects have no git, 2 no remote, 1 has all Compass paths gitignored (iwyc-unreal), 4 were push-rejected behind their remotes (3 ue5-editor-mcp checkouts + wt-spec056) and need a human pull/rebase call. pg-jira-exporter's remote no longer exists.
