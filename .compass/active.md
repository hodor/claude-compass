# Active Tasks

## Done

- [x] Finalize vision spec — resolve open questions in [[SPEC-001-compass-vision-and-architecture]]
- [x] Set up plugin structure — create agents and skills

## In Progress

- [ ] TASK-001: Review and approve all plugin files (21 files) — human approves each file one by one
  - Progress: 3/21 files approved (all 3 skills done, agents next)
  - File 1: `plugin/skills/obsidian/SKILL.md` — APPROVED (session 2)
  - File 2: `plugin/skills/lessons/SKILL.md` — APPROVED (session 3)
    - Added `status` field to catalog schema + search filter
    - Replaced inline template with reference to obsidian skill
    - Search algorithm rewritten: AI judgment instead of mechanical tag matching
    - Added file naming convention (`LESSON-<descriptive-slug>.md`)
    - Added "When to Search" section
  - File 3: `plugin/skills/methodology/SKILL.md` — APPROVED (session 3)
    - No changes needed — handoff timestamp convention confirmed correct
  - Duplication audit: found heavy duplication across agents (templates inlined instead of referencing skills). Will dedup selectively during agent review — keep alignment-critical reminders inline, replace full template copies with references.
  - Files 4-21: not started (15 agents + 3 vault structure files)
  - Next file: agents (file 4 onward)
  - Handoff: [[2026-03-12_session-3-skills-approved]]

## Blocked

_None._

## Next Up

- [ ] Create ADR-001 — document key architectural decisions (methodology as skill, file naming, tasks in active.md)
- [ ] Test bootstrap agent on a fresh project
- [ ] Test spec-writer agent interactively
- [ ] Push to GitHub repository
